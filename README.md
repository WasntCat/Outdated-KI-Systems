Within this Repo is the old applications and such built for our old network, The code is not great and unstable. It was not made to support/Handle all the traffic/Users that came along after our software became Semi-Public use.

Keep the following in note,
1. I will not help if you decide to use any of this project/code
2. I will not responded to any issues/Help request within this repo
3. No idea why would want to, but don't claim any of this doo doo code as yours 
4. No this is not the most super duper secure system ever but is better than your doodoo pastebin 1 bool check


How to setup,
1. Server - Change the port
2. Client - Change the port and server ip


How to add new commands/Request,
1. Just look at the the handlers code


Known Issue's
1. Server log's tend to stroke out/Combine with huge amounts of data coming through at the same time
2. Connecting with a vpn or extremely terrible internet will break sending and receiving the session ID, Client will end up sending a broken form or completely different session ID causing the server to flag there session as invalid and will kick them off the server
3. Server needing to be constantly restarted after about 4 hours of uptime I.E look at the code you'll easily see why
4. Prob some issues i forgot, But just note this is very unstable

Enjoy
